Option 1: Install into Anaconda Python Environment (recommended) 
  GraphLab Create installation requires a Python 2.7.x environment and pip version >= 7 and Anaconda2 v4.0.0 (64-bit). 
  IPython Notebook is recommended.
  GraphLab Create is supported with Anaconda2 v4.0.0. We highly recommend creating your conda environment with these steps.
  
  Step 1: Download Anaconda2 v4.0.0

  Step 2: Install Anaconda
    # Run Anaconda2 v4.0.0 installer.
    bash /path to download file/Anaconda2-4.0.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
    
  Step 3: Create conda environment
    # Create a new conda environment with Python 2.7.x
    conda create -n gl-env python=2.7 anaconda=4.0.0
    # Activate the conda environment
    source activate gl-env
    
  Step 4: Ensure pip version >= 7
    # Ensure pip is updated to the latest version
    # miniconda users may need to install pip first, using 'conda install pip'
    conda update pip
  
  Step 5: Install GraphLab Create
    # Install your licensed copy of GraphLab Create
    pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir https://get.graphlab.com/GraphLab-Create/2.1/1373567326@qq.com/BC05-B1AF-5AE7-2611-E718-0083-BA54-33EF/GraphLab-Create-License.tar.gz
    
  Step 4: Ensure installation of IPython and IPython Notebook
    # Install or update IPython and IPython Notebook
    conda install ipython-notebook
    
    
    
Option 2: Install in Python environment using virtualenv
  The below instructions assume an existing Python 2.7.x (64-bit) environment and virtualenv is already installed on your machine. 
  GraphLab Create installation requires pip version >= 7. IPython Notebook is recommended for getting the most out our code samples.
  Execute the following shell commands:

    Step 1: Create and activate a new virtual environment (recommended)
      # Create a virtual environment named e.g. gl-env
      virtualenv gl-env
      # Activate the virtual environment
      source gl-env/bin/activate
      
    Step 2: Ensure pip version >= 7
      # Make sure pip is up to date
      pip install --upgrade pip
      
    Step 3: Ensure installation of IPython and IPython Notebook
      # Install IPython Notebook (optional)
      pip install "ipython[notebook]"
      
    Step 4: Install GraphLab Create
      # Install your licensed copy of GraphLab Create
      pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir https://get.graphlab.com/GraphLab-Create/2.1/1373567326@qq.com/BC05-B1AF-5AE7-2611-E718-0083-BA54-33EF/GraphLab-Create-License.tar.gz
